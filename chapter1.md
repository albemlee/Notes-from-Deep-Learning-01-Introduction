Which of the following tasks would be more difficult for computers:

`@possible_answers`
- Beat a world champion in the game of chess.
- [Have a typical conversation with an ordinary person.]

`@hint`
Read through page 2 in (Deep Learning book)[http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/intro.html].

`@feedbacks`
- IBM's Deep Blue chess-playing program accomplished this in 1997.
- Correct. This is more difficult because it requires knowledge people generally consider to be intuitive (difficult to formally describe).
